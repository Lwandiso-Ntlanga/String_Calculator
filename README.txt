#String Calculator

This program is of a string calculator, meaning the operator is the prefix and is in a string format.
No modules, packages, frameworks built in or not were used to solve the operations entered by the user.
For instance to add values using a built in framework such Math.addExact() isn't allowed. 
So all methods in the program only use logical processing to solve the expressions.

The user will enter an expression in string format and the output/result will be in string format.
The operator prefix the operands in the expressions.
The available operators are factorial, prime, fibonacci, addition, subtraction, multiplication, division.

It removes the fractal point of the result if the said fractional point is equivalent to 0, e.g 1.0 becomes 1.
